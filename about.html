		<h1 style="margin: -15px auto 20px auto">All About Estie</h1>
		<p>Estie's interest in foreign languages began at an early age when her father showed up one evening with a dinner guest - a Dutch engineer named Willem - who was an international intern visiting her father's workplace. Willem gifted her family a wheel of Gouda cheese, sharing it and teaching them the proper Dutch pronunciation of the word "Gouda.” Willem was the first non-American that she and her siblings had ever met. That first taste of Gouda cheese – although she hadn’t liked it very much at the time - sparked a lifelong interest in everything foreign.</p>
		<p>French was the first foreign language, which Estie learned. She chose this language because her cousin David had won a free trip to France after scoring the highest grade on a test at his high school. Although Estie’s school district didn’t provide the opportunity to win a free trip to France - her parents were kind enough to pay for her trip to visit France, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland with her high school's French club after earning all A’s in her first year of high school French and her aspirations of becoming a French teacher. </p>
		<p>Estie went on to major in the French language in college, adding the Russian language as a double major shortly before the fall of the Soviet Union. Her most favorite experience was getting to know the groups of Soviet aerospace
			<!-- ATF -->engineers and interpreters, who worked at the museum exhibit "Soviet Space" where she was a docent every day after her classes. She took them shopping, sightseeing, and even home with her for Thanksgiving dinner at her parents' house with her siblings and grandparents. Estie added the German language as a minor after the fall of the Berlin Wall while her sister and her sister's German-American fiancé moved to Hamburg. Years later, the two married in Turkey, which brought Estie, her parents, and her brother to Europe where she acted as her family's interpreter helping them order food, book hotel rooms, and receive directions to various places since neither of her parents had ever learned a foreign language; her brother had forgotten all of his high school French and had never taken German classes.</p>
		<p>Estie, a graduate of Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont, USA, started her tutoring company after receiving repeated requests for help in the French, German, and Russian languages. Soon she expanded her company's services to include teaching about culture in addition to language after receiving requests from businesspeople wanting to win and keep clients; families wanting to take "a once in a lifetime vacation," and newlywed couples planning their honeymoon trips to Europe. </p>
