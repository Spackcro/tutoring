## Overview/description: 

Estie's Language Tutoring website is designed to be a one-stop shop for anyone looking for a tutor specializing in the French, German, and Russian languages. 


## Functionality offered:

This basic website is easy to navigate as its 3 pages are linked together using HTML with easily recognizable icons in the navbar. Users will be able to easily navigate between pages in the navbar, which is fixed at the top of the screen rendering the traditional footer unneccesary. This website was developed for varying screen sizes and user interfaces. The background and coloring of the pages provide a consistent theme and follows a "less is more" approach in order to not overwhelm the user. Following this intentional move to not overwhelm the user - the carousel on the index.html page uses transform instead of slide. 


## Technologies used:

- [Bootstrap 5.1.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)
- Flex Box CSS
- HTML&CSS
- JavaScript
